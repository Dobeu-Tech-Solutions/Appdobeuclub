# Dobeu Tech Solutions - Brand Guidelines
*Version 1.0 - November 2025*

## 1. Brand Overview
Dobeu is not your typical corporate tech consultancy. We are the anti-corporate partner for small-to-medium businesses. We are agile, bold, and results-driven.
**Motto:** "Tech is your best friend."

## 2. Tone of Voice
Our voice is **Edgy but Friendly**.
- **Do:** Be direct, punchy, and confident. Use short sentences. Speak like a partner, not a vendor.
- **Don't:** Use corporate jargon (synergy, deep-dive, circle back). Don't be overly formal or stiff.

**Keywords:**
- Bold
- Transparent
- Agile
- Premium
- Fun

## 3. Visual Identity

### Logo
The "Smiley D" is our primary mark.
- **Primary:** White text with Neon Yellow accent on Black background.
- **Reverse:** Black text with Neon Yellow accent on White background.
- **Monochrome:** Use only when color is impossible.

### Color Palette
We use a high-contrast palette with neon accents to signify energy and modern tech.

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Void Black** | `#000000` | Primary Background |
| **Stark White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary Text |
| **Electric Lemon** | `#FACC15` | Primary Accent / Buttons |
| **Neon Rose** | `#EC4899` | Secondary Accent / Gradients |
| **Azure Tech** | `#3B82F6` | Secondary Accent / Gradients |
| **Deep Violet** | `#A855F7` | Secondary Accent / Gradients |

### Typography
We use a sans-serif font stack that is clean and modern (Inter/System UI).

- **Display Headings:** Bold / Extra Bold. Tight tracking (`tracking-tighter`).
- **Body Text:** Light / Regular. Relaxed line height.

## 4. Social Media Guidelines
- **Twitter/X:** Use the "Electric Lemon" branding to stand out in dark mode feeds. Keep posts under 280 chars but high impact.
- **LinkedIn:** Professional but with a twist. Use the "New Partner" templates to celebrate wins.
- **Instagram:** Visual heavy. Use screenshots of work and abstract gradient backgrounds.
